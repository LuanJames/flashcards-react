=========================

## Introduction
This is a sample Web App with ReactJS with Alt for Flux implementation.

Demo here: https://luanjames.github.io/flashcards-react/

## Features

There are already many React examples out there, what's special about this one?
- it uses Alt for Flux architecture
- it uses Alt Container to handle all the data fetching and communication with the stores
- it saves data in your browser
- I wrote a docker-compose ;)

## How to run the sample
### 1. with docker
```
$ docker-compose up
